<h1>Flavoured Oreos: Just a brand and its will to survive</h1>

<p>

n a trip to California in early 2018, I happened upon a huge range of Oreo flavours in a suburban grocery store. Further investigation found that this was in no way an outlier: the average Californian grocery store is now stocked with a mind-boggling selection of Oreos. This was surprising, as my local grocery stores in eastern Ontario typically only have a single shelf devoted to uninspired variations on regular oreos (double stuf [sic], thin, and 33% less fat), with the occasional box of golden Oreos serving only to highlight the scene’s dreariness. Even now, six months later, it’s hard to accept how stunted Canada is in the domain of snack development compared to our neighbour. </p>

<p class="caption">Figure 1a: A smorgasbord of US Oreo flavours on display. The photo's distortion is due to it being a composite of many photos stitched together, a necessary step in capturing such a vast panorama of flavours. Flavours (left to right): original, chocolate, mint, golden, cinnamon bun, mega stuf [sic], peppermint, peanut butter, peeps, birthday cake, cinnamon heart. Note that the Golden Oreo boxes are largely untouched or unopened, a reflection of the fact that they are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo#/media/File:Mr._Christie,_you_definitely_make_good_cookies!_(2523264708).jpg">fucking useless</a>.</p>

<p>Canadians are no stranger to the feeling of envy arising from the delayed implementation of innovations originating in the United States – take, for example, the relatively late adoption of Uber and various delivery services. However, it seems that we are at last catching up. On a recent grocery trip, just as I had begrudgingly accepted regular Oreos as my eternal companion, I stumbled on multiple shelves full of not only the unnecessary ‘double stuf [sic]’ and ‘reduced fat’ members of the Oreo family, not only several boxes of the outdated golden variety, but also cinnamon bun Oreos and thin coconut Oreos. </p>

<p>Elated, I snagged a box of the cinnamon bun Oreos for an upcoming camping trip. In the past, I had overlooked both thin and double stuf [sic] Oreos, viewing them as a redundancy given the well-established original Oreo, but I added a box of the coconut thins, intrigued by the promise of a new flavour. As I introduced the flavoured Oreos to lunch one afternoon, the reaction reflected that something new was afoot, and the discussion was recorded in the spirit of scientific study. I will be discussing the major points of the conversation and the potential consequences implied. </p>

<p>A frequently noted trait of the cinnamon bun Oreos was the ambiguity of their flavour, summed up best by a test subject with the words “hints of cinnamon but not bun”. The flavour was compared to the taste of girl guide cookies and Dunkaroos. This latter comparison is interesting given that <a href="https://blog.generalmills.com/2017/07/a-slam-dunk-graham-cookie-snack/">Dunkaroos were discontinued in the United States in 2012</a>, and in Canada in January 2018. A quick Google search yields countless articles devoted to answering the question, “where can I get Dunkaroos?” The answer used to be through third party sellers such as Amazon, but the end of Dunkaroo production has left such websites <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dunkaroos-Frosting-Sprinkles-separate-detachable/dp/B00MH58QVG/ref=as_at?creativeASIN=B00MH58QVG&linkCode=w50&tag=bustle-20&imprToken=xrODJqhVoQu3AOtqgfmP4g&slotNum=3&th=1">out of stock</a>. It seems that the only remaining option is to replace the unavailable but highly sought after 90s snack, and thus the potential for new Oreo flavours to fill open niches in the dessert ecosystem is evident. </p>

<p>The study suggests that the consumption of cinnamon bun Oreos may stimulate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">neural pathways</a> associated with creative thought. Upon tasting the Oreos, two subjects expressed unconventional ideas, such as the formulation of a novel conspiracy theory concerning the legitimacy of double stuf [sic] Oreos, or reflections on the nature of the colour green. <a href="https://milicabanic.github.io/reviews/oreos.html">A similar effect has been observed with spring Oreos</a> and red velvet Oreos. In the latter case, a spur of the moment experiment demonstrated that red velvet Oreos complemented the experience of attending the symphony, and while no control group was recorded, it certainly didn’t diminish our appreciation for Shostakovich’s fifth symphony. </p>

<p> This connection is reminiscent of the long-standing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse#cite_ref-32">association between coffee and higher thought</a>, with the “rich intellectual atmosphere of early London coffeehouses” earning them the nickname “Penny Universities”. This connection hasn’t been documented with original Oreos. Should the connection between flavoured Oreos and elevated thought persist, the popularity of offbeat Oreo flavours may increase while original Oreos remain stagnant. </p>

<p> With exotic Oreos expanding in popularity, one can’t help but wonder whether the original Oreo will be eclipsed by their success. In the past, the almost overwhelming richness of flavours such as cinnamon and red velvet has forced the Oreo aficionado to remain connected to the original Oreo as a palate cleanser, if nothing else. However, the coconut Oreo’s thinness gives it a lightness which obviates the need for a return to the original Oreo flavour. The group’s response supports this: 4/6 subjects interviewed explicitly stated their preference for coconut thins over cinnamon bun Oreos, and the unanimous ranking following the discussion saw coconut thins at the top, followed by cinnamon bun Oreos, with original Oreos ranked at the bottom. With novelty Oreos catering to more adventurous consumers and options such as coconut thins for those seeking a more delicate snack, it appears that original Oreos no longer have an essential place in the Oreo tapestry. </p>

<p> Those with a nostalgic attachment to the original Oreo need not lament: this type of evolution is necessary for the success of a product and is ubiquitous throughout history. The multinational technology company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">Apple</a> was famous for its ingenious iPod. However, with the advent of tablets and smartphones, the iPod’s features became integrated into new, more highly demanded technology, eventually ending its reign as one of the company’s flagship products. While loyal users may have been reluctant to let go of the iPod’s heyday, most look upon Apple’s forward thinking and unyielding progress positively. The same attitude should be applied to Oreos. </p>

<p> New advances are often greeted with apprehension. However, the expanded range of Oreo flavours was embraced wholeheartedly by everyone interviewed, with the consensus being that the coconut thin Oreos were superior to the cinnamon bun ones, both being an improvement over regular Oreos. While long time Oreo lovers may find it hard to watch their old favourite get sidelined, the brand’s willingness to diversify in order to thrive should be celebrated. </p>
